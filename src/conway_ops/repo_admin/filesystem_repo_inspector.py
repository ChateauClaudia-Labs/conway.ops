            (Preliminary) UPSHOT: this tells that lines 0,1,2,4 give us the hash, author, date and summary, and lines 6+ the 
                files that changed.

            The above needs to be more nuanced, because if a commit is a merge, then it looks like this:

                0: e7f556f218ad218a2484581e0b7efec522dcf33a

                5:    
                6:    First MVP

            So for the (real UPSHOT):
            - As we parse lines, if they start with "Author:" or "Date", that is whwere we get these fields from
            - If a list is not blank but starts with blanks, then we treat it as part of the Summary
            - Only when we are past the lines that start with blanks we assume we have the committed files
            - And be aware that for merge commits, there might not be any files at all...
