    Helper class used to represent a bundle of repos that is a subset of another bundle.
    An example use case is when there is a partial fork of some, but not all, the repos that comprise
    an application. In that case this class comes handy to create a ``RepoBundle`` object that
    represents the partial fork, and thereby allow fork developers to leverage the services
    of the :class:`BranchLifechcleManager` even if they did not fork all the repos of the application.

    :param list[str] subset_repo_names: names of the repos in ``full_bundle`` that comprise the subset
        of repos which are bundled into this :class:`RepoBundleSubset` instance.
