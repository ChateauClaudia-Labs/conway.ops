    '''
    Utility class containing useful methods to invoke in notebooks associated to the development-time and runtime
    operations of a Conway-based application.
    
    It is expected to be used as a singleton: construct it only once and use it throughout a notebook.

    It also handles some environmental needs, such as:

    * Automatically importing required modules as part of constructing an instance of this class. This makes
      notebooks less cluttered by not having to include them in the notebook itself.

    * Also on construction, it will get, maintain and display information about which application environment is being used
      to run the notebook using this class. 

    :param str project_name: name of Conway-based application. Used in displays and to access names of repos
